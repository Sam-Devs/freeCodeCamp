Border Collapse
The border-collapse property is for use on <table> elements (or elements made to behave like a table through display: table or display: inline-table). There are two values:

separate (default) - in which all table cells have their own independent borders and there may be space between those cells as well.
collapse - in which both the space and the borders between table cells collapse so there is only one border and no space between cells.

table {
  border-collapse: separate; /* Or do nothing, this is default */
  border-spacing: 3px; /* Only works if border-collapse is separate */
}

table {
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

align-items
The align-items property is a sub-property of the Flexible Box Layout module.

It defines the default behaviour for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. You can think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).

The align-items property accepts 5 different values:

flex-start: cross-start margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-start line
flex-end: cross-end margin edge of the items is placed on the cross-end line
center: items are centered in the cross-axis
baseline: items are aligned such as their baselines align
stretch (default): stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
The following figure helps understand how flex items are layed out depending on the align-items value.
Syntax:
align-items: flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch

.flex-container {
  align-items: flex-start;
}
