Counter-Increment
Ordered lists aren't the only elements that can be automatically numbered. Thanks to the various counter-related properties, any element can be.

<body>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
  <section></section>
</body>

body {
  counter-reset: my-awesome-counter;
}
section {
  counter-increment: my-awesome-counter;
}
section:before {
  content: counter(my-awesome-counter);
}
Each <section> will respectively start with "1", "2", "3", or "4".

You can control the style of the counter by comma separating the counter function. e.g. to make them use Roman numerals:

section:before {
  content: counter(my-awesome-counter, upper-roman);
}
